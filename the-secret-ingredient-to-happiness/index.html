Everything is a creation, a discussion, a breathing, a step, a gesture when it is blended with authenticity.</p><blockquote>Authenticity is freedom and peace of mind.</blockquote><p>I think there are different persons to whom we can be authentic everyday:</p><ul><li><strong>With yourself</strong>. Well that’s the starting point, not the easiest sometimes but crucial to me. What I do to check that I am authentic with myself is I ask myself a few questions like “Am I ok with that ? Is that what I really want? Am I proud of this? Am I being an asshole?”. It doesn’t take too long to get the answer, you feel it in your body.</li><li><strong>With your friends</strong>. What a relief when you can just enjoy yourself with friends. What a relief when you can for a minute stop trying to be the best, the funniest, the coolest etc. And just spend some quality time with friends, connecting, listening, having fun and discovering life together.</li><li><strong>With your partner.</strong>This one paradoxically is not the easiest one, but it is certainly the one with the biggest benefits. Your couple become very creative and peaceful when you can be yourself and put your ego aside.</li><li><strong>With your kids</strong>. I believe kids can feel when we are authentic with them. They have a bullshit scanner and they get attracted only by authentic people. They are very good at cutting the crap, and they can feel when you are lying and living someone else’s life. Connecting with kids is a pure and relaxing experience.</li><li><strong>With your clients</strong>. Trust & long term relationship, you are working to serve them, and you do your best to help and meet their needs. They pay you because you add value to them, and they appreciate your authenticity. When you have good intentions, nothing bad can happen to you. Everybody wins.</li><li><strong>With your colleagues</strong>. This one I find it freaking awesome, what if we could just be ourself and let our magic operates. Instead of feeling insecure and developing some silly tactics to get the promotion. I think the winners are the ones acting with transparency and authenticity. This is the real skill. That’s how you develop trust around you, and in business trust is everything.</li><li><strong>With every person</strong>…</li></ul><p>Overall, authenticity helps you getting closer to what you really want in life. I’m still learning and I enjoy it. Every day in every situation I try to ask myself “am I being authentic here or am I just playing a role?”. The more I practice it, the more I enjoy it. It’s a very calm and relaxing experience.</p><p>Try it for a moment, try to act as if there were no more games, nothing at stakes, apart from trying to connect with others and be yourself. It’s refreshing isn’t it?</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="19"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="20"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="21"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="22"><span data-reactid="23"><!-- react-empty: 24 --><h2 data-reactid="25"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="26">The secret ingredient to happiness</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="29"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
